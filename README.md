# 🚀 Data Science COMPLETE Roadmap (Beginner → Expert)

Welcome to my **Data Science Learning Journey**! 🎓  
This repository documents my 4-month roadmap to becoming a Data Scientist, following a structured path covering **Python, Mathematics, Statistics, SQL, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning**.  

I will be **pushing updates regularly** as I solve problems, build projects, and complete milestones.

## 📅 Learning Plan (180-Day Roadmap)

### Phase 1: Python (Weeks 1–4)
- Basics: Variables, Loops, Conditionals, Functions
- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets
- File Handling, Error Handling, OOPs
- Problem-Solving with 100+ Python exercises

### Phase 2: Mathematics & Statistics (Weeks 5–8)
- Descriptive Statistics (Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Std Dev)
- Probability & Combinatorics
- Hypothesis Testing, p-values, T-tests, Chi-Square
- Hands-on with NumPy & Pandas

### Phase 3: Data Preprocessing & Visualization (Weeks 9–11)
- Data Cleaning: Missing Values, Outliers, Encoding, Scaling
- pandas & numpy Deep Dive
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Phase 4: SQL (Weeks 12–14)
- SQL Basics: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, Joins
- Aggregations, GROUP BY, HAVING
- Window Functions, Subqueries, CTEs
- Mini SQL Projects

### Phase 5: Machine Learning (Weeks 15–21)
- Linear & Logistic Regression
- KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forests
- SVM, Naive Bayes, Clustering (KMeans, DBSCAN)
- Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning
- End-to-End ML Project

### Phase 6: Deep Learning (Weeks 22–25)
- ANN Basics (Perceptron, Backpropagation)
- TensorFlow/Keras Implementation
- CNNs for Image Classification
- RNNs & LSTMs for Sequential Data
- Final Deep Learning Project

### Phase 7: Specialization (Week 26)
- Choose Track: NLP, Computer Vision, BI Tools, or Data Engineering
- Capstone Project + Deployment
- Build Portfolio + Resume Prep
