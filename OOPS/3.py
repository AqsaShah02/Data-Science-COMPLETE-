# 1Ô∏è‚É£ INHERITANCE ‚Äî All Types (Single, Multiple, Multilevel) + super() + Constructor

# üß© Question:
# Write a Python program to demonstrate Single, Multiple, and Multilevel inheritance.
# Your code must:

# Include constructors in all parent classes.

# Use super() to call the parent constructor inside the child class.

# Demonstrate how Method Resolution Order (MRO) works when multiple parents are inherited.

# Show how attributes and methods are accessed from each level of inheritance.

# üí° Hint:
# Include:

# A Grandparent class with family_name

# A Parent class inheriting Grandparent, adding parent_name

# A Mother class as a second parent

# A Child class inheriting both Parent and Mother

# Demonstrate constructor execution order and method inheritance.

    person = "Mr. Shah"
